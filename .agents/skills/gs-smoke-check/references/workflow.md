## Native coherence consumption

Run coherence --root <project-root> and consume observations/counts JSON. It compares
declared engine facts with project-owned VERSION records and actual project settings,
rendering/2D physics usage, explicit test/script entries and export preset names.
Installed binary is NOT ASSESSED by default; only after inspecting/authorizing
commands.engine_probe may coherence --probe run it and retain an execution receipt.
Missing/unimplemented checks remain named NOT ASSESSED. Resolve every DIFFERS;
no empty/successful helper output proves engine consistency or a game build.
Read .game-studio/resources/docs/engine-reference-resolution.md; project records, not packaged examples, govern.

## Project engine reference contract

When engine facts or APIs matter, explicitly run the native engine-reference command
and read .game-studio/resources/docs/engine-reference-resolution.md. <project-engine-reference> means its resolved
project.root and project.documents. Use actual project version/verification records;
missing records remain unknown. Packaged engine versions are historical background,
never project authority. Confirm current official APIs and actual toolchain before claims.

## Native execution contract

Use current project instructions, user authorization and inherited model/permissions.
Read `.game-studio/resources/docs/native-runtime.md` for platform mechanics and only
the domain references needed for this task. Config is an explicit command, not shell
preprocessing. Workflow inputs come from the user's request, not injected variables.
Tool-shaped examples below are procedural briefs; use tools actually exposed by the
host. They do not declare APIs or grant permissions. Existing task authorization
satisfies routine writes already in scope; do not repeat per-file approval questions.

Roles describe expertise. Delegate only when authorized and useful; otherwise apply
the role yourself and label the review as performed by the parent. Never fabricate
participant IDs, independent reviews or sign-off. Record real delegated participants.
Missing evidence means NOT ASSESSED — NO DATA. Resolve engine/version from this
project; engine reference versions are examples and require current verification.

## Resolve this run's settings

Run `python .game-studio/runtime/studio.py config --root <project-root>` explicitly. Use effective values and provenance. If duplicate keys are reported, inspect the merged values to repair configuration before dependent writes or commands.


# Smoke Check

This skill is the gate between "implementation done" and "ready for QA
hand-off". It runs the automated test suite, checks for test coverage gaps,
batch-verifies critical paths with the developer, and produces a PASS/FAIL
report.

The rule is simple: **a build that fails smoke check does not go to QA.**
Handing a broken build to QA wastes their time and demoralises the team.

**Output:** `production/qa/smoke-[date].md`

---

Every `ask the user` call follows `.game-studio/resources/docs/automation-modes.md`
(collaborative resolves open decisions · guided major-only · autonomous logs and proceeds;
`automation_always_ask` categories always prompt).

**`qa.level`**: at `minimal`, smoke-check is **optional** — if
run, a FAIL is advisory and never blocks hand-off, and a project with no game
tests is checked by its build, launch and critical paths alone (Phase 1 step 1); at `standard`, it is required
before a phase transition; at `full`, before every commit. This sits in front of
the Phase 6 `testing.strict.config` resolution (which only matters once a smoke run
gates). Distinct axis from `workflow`.

## Parse Arguments

Arguments can be combined: `$gs-smoke-check sprint --platform console`

**Base mode** (first argument, default: `sprint`):
- `sprint` — full smoke check against the current sprint's stories
- `quick` — skip coverage scan (Phase 3) and Batch 3; use for rapid re-checks

**Platform flag** (`--platform`, default: none):
- `--platform pc` — add PC-specific checks (keyboard, mouse, windowed mode)
- `--platform console` — add console-specific checks (gamepad, TV safe zones,
  platform certification requirements)
- `--platform mobile` — add mobile-specific checks (touch, portrait/landscape,
  battery/thermal behaviour)
- `--platform all` — add all platform variants; output per-platform verdict table

If `--platform` is provided, Phase 4 adds platform-specific batches and
Phase 5 outputs a per-platform verdict table in addition to the overall verdict.

## Collaborative Protocol

**Applies in `collaborative` mode (the default).** For `guided` and
`autonomous` modes, see `.game-studio/resources/docs/automation-modes.md` — the rules below
describe what collaborative mode requires, not universal behavior.

- **Never treat NOT RUN as automatic FAIL** — record it as NOT RUN and let
  the developer confirm status manually. Unconfirmed NOT RUN yields **NOT
  ASSESSED**, not FAIL — and not a pass verdict either.
- **Never auto-fix failures** — report them and state what must be resolved.
  Do not attempt to edit source code or test files.
- **PASS WITH WARNINGS does not block QA hand-off** — it records advisory
  gaps for `$gs-story-done` to follow up on.
- **`quick` argument** skips Phase 3 (coverage scan) and Phase 4 Batch 3.
  Use it for rapid re-checks after fixing a specific failure.
- Use `ask the user` for all manual smoke check verification.
- **Never write the report without asking** — Phase 6 requires explicit
  approval before any file is created.
