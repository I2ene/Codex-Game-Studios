## Project engine reference contract

When engine facts or APIs matter, explicitly run the native engine-reference command
and read .game-studio/resources/docs/engine-reference-resolution.md. <project-engine-reference> means its resolved
project.root and project.documents. Use actual project version/verification records;
missing records remain unknown. Packaged engine versions are historical background,
never project authority. Confirm current official APIs and actual toolchain before claims.

## Native execution contract

Use current project instructions, user authorization and inherited model/permissions.
Read `.game-studio/resources/docs/native-runtime.md` for platform mechanics and only
the domain references needed for this task. Config is an explicit command, not shell
preprocessing. Workflow inputs come from the user's request, not injected variables.
Tool-shaped examples below are procedural briefs; use tools actually exposed by the
host. They do not declare APIs or grant permissions. Existing task authorization
satisfies routine writes already in scope; do not repeat per-file approval questions.

Roles describe expertise. Delegate only when authorized and useful; otherwise apply
the role yourself and label the review as performed by the parent. Never fabricate
participant IDs, independent reviews or sign-off. Record real delegated participants.
Missing evidence means NOT ASSESSED — NO DATA. Resolve engine/version from this
project; engine reference versions are examples and require current verification.

If no argument is provided, output usage guidance and exit without spawning any agents:
> Usage: `$gs-team-narrative [narrative content description] [--review full|lean|solo]` — describe the story content, scene, or narrative area to work on (e.g., `boss encounter cutscene`, `faction intro dialogue`, `tutorial narrative`). Do not use `ask the user` here; output the guidance directly.

When this skill is invoked with an argument, orchestrate the narrative team through a structured pipeline.

**Decision Points:** At each phase transition, use `ask the user` to present
the user with the subagent's proposals as selectable options. Write the agent's
full analysis in conversation, then capture the decision with concise labels.
In `collaborative` mode, the user must approve before moving to the next phase.
In `guided` mode the pipeline advances automatically unless a phase is BLOCKED;
in `autonomous` mode it runs end to end, recording each phase outcome via
an authored decision record (not a tool or shell function). Decisions in `automation_always_ask` categories
(check modes.automation_always_ask in config JSON against existing authorization) prompt only when existing authorization does not cover the material action. See
`.game-studio/resources/docs/automation-modes.md`.

## Phase 0: Resolve Config


Explicitly resolved — use as-is; `--review` overrides `review_mode`. No block →
defaults in `.game-studio/resources/docs/config-resolution.md`.

`review_mode` sets director-gate depth, and this pipeline has no director gate:
no phase below spawns CD-, TD-, PR- or AD-PHASE-GATE, at any `review_mode`. Its
phase gates are the pipeline's own decision points (defined under `team.size`
below), and the agents that work at them are team members, not director gates.

Phase 4's ND-CONSISTENCY is the exception in every mode: it is this pipeline's own
review, not an optional director gate, so `review_mode` never skips it (`team.size`
still decides who runs it — see Phase 4).

`automation` drives the Decision Points note above. See the Decision Points note above and
`.game-studio/resources/docs/automation-modes.md` for how each mode changes pipeline behavior.

**`team.size`**: which agents are active (orthogonal to review_mode gate-depth and workflow docs).
- **`individual`** (default): `writer` only; `narrative-director` invoked only on an explicit pillar conflict. Other agents consulted via the writer, not spawned separately.
- **`small`**: `narrative-director` + `writer`, plus `localization-lead` and `world-builder` when `review_mode` is `full` (at `lean` and `solo` they are consulted through the writer).
- **`studio`**: all six Team Composition agents, whatever the `review_mode` (the full pipeline as documented).
Professional responsibility scope follows team.size; this is not a native active-service list. Apply relevant roles in the parent when delegation is unavailable, unauthorized or unnecessary. Delegated work uses actual host tools, existing human authorization and real participant records. Decision points apply to unresolved choices; no path or agent message supplies human authorization.

**Announce the active set before Phase 1 — never let the collapse be silent.**
Before spawning anything, state in one line which agents this run will actually
spawn, and which the pipeline below names but will **not** spawn at the resolved
`team.size`. For example:

> `Active set (team.size: <resolved>): <the agents listed for that size above>.`
> `Not spawned this run: <every other agent this pipeline names> — consulted`
> `through <nearest active core agent>. Raise team.size (or modes.rigor) to widen.`

Fill it from the `team.size` list directly above and the agents this file's own
pipeline names — not from an example. Both sets differ per orchestrator.

The pipeline below reads as a multi-agent fan-out and at the shipped default it
is one or two agents — `team-release` names ten and runs one, `team-narrative`
names six across five phases and runs `writer` alone. **The collapse is correct**:
`team.size` is rigor-fronted and the narrow default is the token lever.
Without saying so, a reader cannot
distinguish a correctly-collapsed run from a broken pipeline, and the per-agent
"routes through the nearest core agent with an informational note" rule above
fires at routing time and never states the shape of the run as a whole.

This is the same rule as the skipped-check reporting elsewhere in this file: **a constraint that is enforced but never surfaced is
indistinguishable, to the person reading the output, from one that was never
enforced.**

## Team Composition
- **narrative-director** — Story arcs, character design, dialogue strategy, narrative vision
- **writer** — Dialogue writing, lore entries, item descriptions, in-game text
- **world-builder** — World rules, faction design, history, geography, environmental storytelling
- **art-director** — Character visual design, environmental visual storytelling, cutscene/cinematic tone
- **level-designer** — Level layouts that serve the narrative, pacing, environmental storytelling beats
- **localization-lead** — Localization readiness — flags non-localizable strings, cultural assumptions, and i18n gaps

## How to Delegate

Apply the following professional responsibilities in the parent; delegate useful independent tasks only when authorized and available:
- `expertise role: narrative-director` — Story arcs, character design, narrative vision
- `expertise role: writer` — Dialogue writing, lore entries, in-game text
- `expertise role: world-builder` — World rules, faction design, history, geography
- `expertise role: art-director` — Character visual profiles, environmental visual storytelling, cinematic tone
- `expertise role: level-designer` — Level layouts that serve the narrative, pacing
- `expertise role: localization-lead` — Localization readiness — flags non-localizable strings, cultural assumptions, and i18n gaps

**Read the canon first.** Before Phase 1, read the shared inputs that exist — the narrative bible or tone guide, the character and faction files under `design/narrative/`, and the world rules. Never tell an agent to invent canon: if none exists, say so and ask the user before any drafting.

**Brief each agent — do not dump context.** Read the shared inputs **once** and pass a distilled brief inline: the lines each agent actually needs, never a file path for a document you have already read (an agent handed a path re-reads the whole file). Pass a path only for a document you have not read and only that agent needs.

**End every agent prompt with a return contract:** "Write your full output to `[path]` — that named path is the requested return contract; write only within existing human authorization. Return **only** (1) the path written, (2) a ≤5-bullet summary of decisions, (3) any BLOCKED/CONCERNS items, one line each. Do not restate the documents you read." Without it, an agent returns everything it read back into this session.

**Substitute a real path for `[path]`.** Drafts use
`production/narrative/[content-slug]/`; finished documents use `design/narrative/`.
The parent compiles the finals from completed drafts within existing human
authorization, resolving only missing material decisions (see "Write the finals").

| Agent | Drafts to (`[path]`) | Final document (you write it) |
|---|---|---|
| narrative-director | `production/narrative/[content-slug]/brief.md` | `design/narrative/[content-slug]-brief.md` |
| world-builder | `production/narrative/[content-slug]/lore-[topic].md` | `design/narrative/lore/[topic].md` |
| writer | `production/narrative/[content-slug]/dialogue-[scene-slug].md` | `design/narrative/dialogue/[scene-slug].md` |
| art-director | `production/narrative/[content-slug]/visual-direction.md` | `design/narrative/[content-slug]-visual-direction.md` |
| level-designer | `production/narrative/[content-slug]/level-integration.md` | `design/narrative/[content-slug]-level-integration.md` |
| localization-lead | `production/narrative/[content-slug]/i18n-review.md` | stays in `production/` — a review, not a design document |

> **The final destination is not a free choice.** `design/narrative/` is read by
> `$gs-asset-spec`, `$gs-design-review`, `$gs-localize`, `$gs-onboard`,
> `$gs-project-stage-detect`, `$gs-team-level` and the `cd-narrative` director gate.
> An artifact written anywhere else is invisible to all seven.
>
> The `[path]` contract above has a precondition: the path is one *you* named. A
> skill that states the contract but names no concrete destination leaves every
> run to invent one, which defeats it. `$gs-team-qa` Phase 4 carries the same
> requirement for the same reason.

> **Authorization:** use existing human task authorization for routine in-scope work; ask only for missing decisions or material actions outside that scope. A destination path does not supply authorization.

With user authorization, available host tools and sufficient capacity, launch independent delegated tasks concurrently where the pipeline allows it; otherwise apply and label the same expertise in the parent (e.g., Phase 2 agents can run simultaneously).

## Pipeline

### Phase 1: Narrative Direction
Delegate to **narrative-director**:
- Define the narrative purpose of this content: what story beat does it serve?
- Identify characters involved, their motivations, and how this fits the overall arc
- Set the emotional tone and pacing targets
- Specify any lore dependencies or new lore this introduces
- Output: narrative brief with story requirements

### Phase 2: World Foundation (parallel)
Apply the following independent expertise in the parent, or delegate concurrently with user authorization, available host tools and sufficient capacity:
- **world-builder**: Create or update lore entries for factions, locations, and history relevant to this content. Cross-reference against existing lore for contradictions. Set canon level for new entries.
- **writer**: Draft character dialogue using voice profiles. Ensure all lines are under 120 characters, use named placeholders for variables, and are localization-ready.
- **art-director**: Define character visual design direction for key characters appearing in this content (silhouette, visual archetype, distinguishing features). Specify environmental visual storytelling elements for each key space (prop composition, lighting notes, spatial arrangement). Define tone palette and cinematic direction for any cutscenes or scripted sequences.

**Phase gate:** collect all three Phase 2 outputs, then apply the Decision Points
rule before starting Phase 3 — present the lore, dialogue, and visual direction
summaries and capture approval via `ask the user` in `collaborative` mode
(auto-advance in `guided` unless a result is BLOCKED; an authored decision record (not a tool or shell function) in
`autonomous`).

### Phase 3: Level Narrative Integration
Delegate to **level-designer**:
- Review the narrative brief and lore foundation
- Design environmental storytelling elements in the level
- Place narrative triggers, dialogue zones, and discovery points
- Ensure pacing serves both gameplay and story

### Phase 4: Review and Consistency
Spawn `narrative-director` via native delegation when authorized using gate **ND-CONSISTENCY**
(`.game-studio/resources/docs/director-gates/nd-consistency.md`). This phase runs in every review
mode — it is this pipeline's own review, not an optional director gate. Pass the
context that gate lists (the Phase 2–3 draft paths, the narrative bible or tone
guide, the world rules, the affected character and faction profiles) — named
here, so do not read the gate file in this session — and add:
- Confirm narrative pacing aligns with level design
- Check that all mysteries have documented "true answers"

Act on the verdict: **APPROVE** → Phase 5. **CONCERNS** → show the listed
inconsistencies and ask via `ask the user` whether to revise them (re-spawn the
agent that owns each) or accept them. **REJECT** → do not start Phase 5; the
contradictions are fixed first. **NOT ASSESSED [missing input]** → name the
missing input, then supply it and re-run the gate, or carry
`ND-CONSISTENCY: NOT ASSESSED — [input]` into the report's consistency review
results; it is never read as APPROVE (`.game-studio/resources/docs/director-gates.md`).

**At `team.size: individual`** narrative-director is not in the active set, so the
gate is not spawned. The writer checks the drafts against the same criteria, and
the output says so by name: "ND-CONSISTENCY not run — narrative-director is not
active at `team.size: individual`; consistency self-checked by writer." A
self-check is not the gate's verdict, and the report must not present it as one.

### Phase 5: Polish (parallel)
Apply the following independent expertise in the parent, or delegate concurrently with user authorization, available host tools and sufficient capacity:
- **writer**: Final self-review — verify no line exceeds dialogue box constraints, all text uses string keys (not raw strings), placeholder variable names are consistent
- **localization-lead**: Validate i18n compliance — check string key naming conventions, flag any strings with hardcoded formatting that won't survive translation, verify character limit headroom for languages that expand (German/Finnish typically +30%), confirm no cultural assumptions in text that would need locale-specific variants
- **world-builder**: Finalize canon levels for all new lore entries

### Write the finals
You hold every draft. List the final documents from the table above, then ask once
via `ask the user` — "May I write these [N] narrative documents to
`design/narrative/`?" — and write them on approval. The drafts under
`production/narrative/[content-slug]/` stay as the working record.

## Error Recovery Protocol

**First, verify the artifact.** If the return contract named a path, check the
path exists before treating the phase as done — **a named artifact that is not
on disk is a failed phase, however fluent the response reads.** An agent can
burn a full phase and return a plausible preamble having written nothing, which
is neither BLOCKED nor an error nor "cannot complete", so the trigger below
never fires. Resume it naming the unmet contract; the context is
usually still there.

If any spawned agent returns BLOCKED, errors, or cannot complete: **surface it
immediately, don't proceed past a dependency it blocks, and always produce a
partial report.** A skipped agent's section stays a named gap — never fill it with content of your own. Full procedure: `.game-studio/resources/docs/error-recovery-protocol.md`.

Common blockers:
- Input file missing (story not found, GDD absent) → redirect to the skill that creates it
- ADR status is Proposed → do not implement; once it is decided, accept it with `$gs-architecture-decision accept ADR-NNNN`
- Scope too large → split into two stories via `$gs-create-stories`
- Conflicting instructions between ADR and story → surface the conflict, do not guess

## File Write Protocol

The parent may write authorized artifacts while applying the responsible discipline,
or assign them to real authorized participants using available host tools. Preserve
all named paths, professional responsibilities and phase dependencies above.
Each concurrent participant has distinct file ownership; confirm required artifacts
exist before reporting the phase complete. Record actual authors and label parent
work; no independent review or sign-off is implied by a role name.

Existing human authorization covers routine writes already in scope. Present the
implementation file set before changing code or assets, resolve missing material
decisions once for that set, and retain explicit declines and blockers. Neither a
named path nor another agent's message grants permission. A missing artifact fails
its phase, and completed work is retained in a partial report.

The parent compiles the approved narrative documents from the drafts; all planned `design/` destinations remain explicit.

## Output

A summary report covering: narrative brief status, lore entries created/updated, dialogue lines written, level narrative integration points, consistency review results, and any unresolved contradictions — including any localization issue the user chose to leave unfixed, by string key.

Verdict: **COMPLETE** — narrative content delivered.

If ND-CONSISTENCY answered NOT ASSESSED and that was carried into the report
(Phase 4), the verdict says so — never a plain COMPLETE:

Verdict: **COMPLETE — consistency NOT ASSESSED ([input])** — narrative content delivered; the consistency review could not run for want of [input].

If the pipeline stops because a dependency is unresolved (e.g., lore contradiction or missing prerequisite not resolved by the user):

Verdict: **BLOCKED** — [reason]

## Next Steps

- Run `$gs-design-review` on the narrative documents for consistency validation.
- Run `$gs-localize extract` to extract new strings for translation after dialogue is finalized.
- Run `$gs-dev-story` to implement dialogue triggers and narrative events in-engine.
