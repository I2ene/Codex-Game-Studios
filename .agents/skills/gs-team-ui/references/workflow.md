## Project engine reference contract

When engine facts or APIs matter, explicitly run the native engine-reference command
and read .game-studio/resources/docs/engine-reference-resolution.md. <project-engine-reference> means its resolved
project.root and project.documents. Use actual project version/verification records;
missing records remain unknown. Packaged engine versions are historical background,
never project authority. Confirm current official APIs and actual toolchain before claims.

## Native execution contract

Use current project instructions, user authorization and inherited model/permissions.
Read `.game-studio/resources/docs/native-runtime.md` for platform mechanics and only
the domain references needed for this task. Config is an explicit command, not shell
preprocessing. Workflow inputs come from the user's request, not injected variables.
Tool-shaped examples below are procedural briefs; use tools actually exposed by the
host. They do not declare APIs or grant permissions. Existing task authorization
satisfies routine writes already in scope; do not repeat per-file approval questions.

Roles describe expertise. Delegate only when authorized and useful; otherwise apply
the role yourself and label the review as performed by the parent. Never fabricate
participant IDs, independent reviews or sign-off. Record real delegated participants.
Missing evidence means NOT ASSESSED — NO DATA. Resolve engine/version from this
project; engine reference versions are examples and require current verification.

If no argument is provided, output usage guidance and exit without spawning any agents or reading any design files:
> Usage: `$gs-team-ui [UI feature description] [--review full|lean|solo]` — describe the screen or UI feature to build (e.g., `inventory screen`, `main menu`, `combat HUD`). Do not use `ask the user` here; output the guidance directly.

When this skill is invoked, orchestrate the UI team through a structured pipeline.

**Decision Points:** At each phase transition, use `ask the user` to present
the user with the subagent's proposals as selectable options. Write the agent's
full analysis in conversation, then capture the decision with concise labels.
In `collaborative` mode, the user must approve before moving to the next phase.
In `guided` mode the pipeline advances automatically unless a phase is BLOCKED;
in `autonomous` mode it runs end to end, recording each phase outcome via
an authored decision record (not a tool or shell function). Decisions in `automation_always_ask` categories
(check modes.automation_always_ask in config JSON against existing authorization) prompt only when existing authorization does not cover the material action. See
`.game-studio/resources/docs/automation-modes.md`.

## Phase 0: Resolve Config


Explicitly resolved — use as-is; `--review` overrides `review_mode`. No block →
defaults in `.game-studio/resources/docs/config-resolution.md`.

`review_mode` sets director-gate depth, and this pipeline has no director gate:
no phase below spawns CD-, TD-, PR- or AD-PHASE-GATE, at any `review_mode`. Its
phase gates are the pipeline's own decision points (defined under `team.size`
below), and the agents that work at them are team members, not director gates.

`automation` drives the Decision Points note above. See the Decision Points note above and
`.game-studio/resources/docs/automation-modes.md` for how each mode changes pipeline behavior.

**`team.size`**: which agents are active (orthogonal to review_mode gate-depth and workflow docs).
- **`individual`** (default): `ui-programmer` + `ux-designer`. Other agents consulted via these two, not spawned separately.
- **`small`**: + `accessibility-specialist` + `art-director`.
- **`studio`**: + engine UI specialist + an adversarial review pass: Phase 4's reviewers are told "your job is not to confirm this matches the spec — find where it fails it", and the report says the pass ran.
Professional responsibility scope follows team.size; this is not a native active-service list. Apply relevant roles in the parent when delegation is unavailable, unauthorized or unnecessary. Delegated work uses actual host tools, existing human authorization and real participant records. Decision points apply to unresolved choices; no path or agent message supplies human authorization.

**Announce the active set before Step 1 — never let the collapse be silent.**
Before spawning anything, state in one line which agents this run will actually
spawn, and which the pipeline below names but will **not** spawn at the resolved
`team.size`. For example:

> `Active set (team.size: <resolved>): <the agents listed for that size above>.`
> `Not spawned this run: <every other agent this pipeline names> — consulted`
> `through <nearest active core agent>. Raise team.size (or modes.rigor) to widen.`

Fill it from the `team.size` list directly above and the agents this file's own
pipeline names — not from an example. Both sets differ per orchestrator.

The pipeline below reads as a multi-agent fan-out and at the shipped default it
is one or two agents — `team-release` names ten and runs one, `team-narrative`
names six across five phases and runs `writer` alone. **The collapse is correct**:
`team.size` is rigor-fronted and the narrow default is the token lever.
Without saying so, a reader cannot
distinguish a correctly-collapsed run from a broken pipeline, and the per-agent
"routes through the nearest core agent with an informational note" rule above
fires at routing time and never states the shape of the run as a whole.

This is the same rule as the skipped-check reporting elsewhere in this file: **a constraint that is enforced but never surfaced is
indistinguishable, to the person reading the output, from one that was never
enforced.**

**Director gate skip rule**: Before spawning creative-director, art-director, or any other Tier 1/2 director for review (outside of PHASE-GATE triggers), apply the resolved mode: skip if solo mode; skip if lean mode and this is not a PHASE-GATE.

## Team Composition
- **ux-designer** — User flows, wireframes, accessibility, input handling
- **ui-programmer** — UI framework, screens, widgets, data binding, implementation
- **art-director** — Visual style, layout polish, consistency with art bible
- **engine UI specialist** — Validates UI implementation patterns against engine-specific best practices (`specialists.ui` from `project.yaml`; if absent, the UI Specialist line of `## Engine Specialists` in `docs/project-reference/technical-preferences.md`)
- **accessibility-specialist** — Audits accessibility compliance at Phase 4

> **`specialists.ui: null` means UNSET.** Treat it as absent and skip the engine
> UI specialist; never spawn `null` as an agent name. The v1.0 migration writes
> the whole `specialists` block whenever any one member is set, so `null` here is
> ordinary — and the config reader returns it as the non-empty string `"null"`.

**Templates used by this pipeline:**
- `ux-spec.md` — Standard screen/flow UX specification
- `hud-design.md` — HUD-specific UX specification
- `interaction-pattern-library.md` — Reusable interaction patterns
- `accessibility-requirements.md` — Committed accessibility tier and requirements

## How to Delegate

Apply the following professional responsibilities in the parent; delegate useful independent tasks only when authorized and available:
- `expertise role: ux-designer` — User flows, wireframes, accessibility, input handling
- `expertise role: ui-programmer` — UI framework, screens, widgets, data binding
- `expertise role: art-director` — Visual style, layout polish, art bible consistency
- `expertise role: [UI engine specialist]` — Engine-specific UI pattern validation (e.g., unity-ui-specialist, ue-umg-specialist, godot-specialist)
- `expertise role: accessibility-specialist` — Accessibility compliance audit

**Brief each agent — do not dump context.** Read the shared inputs **once** and pass a distilled brief inline: the lines each agent actually needs, never a file path for a document you have already read (an agent handed a path re-reads the whole file). Pass a path only for a document you have not read and only that agent needs.

**End every agent prompt with a return contract:** "Write your full output to `[path]` — that named path is the requested return contract; write only within existing human authorization. Return **only** (1) the path written, (2) a ≤5-bullet summary of decisions, (3) any BLOCKED/CONCERNS items, one line each. Do not restate the documents you read." Without it, an agent returns everything it read back into this session. **Implementation work:** first state the files that will be created or changed. Existing human authorization covers in-scope changes; resolve any missing material decision once for the set before writing. A role or path supplies no permission.

**Substitute a real path for `[path]`.** Working artifacts go under
`production/ui/[feature-name]/`, the slug Phase 1b's `design/ux/[feature-name].md`
uses. One file per agent, so the parallel Phase 4 reviews never share one:

| Phase / agent | Writes to |
|---|---|
| 2 art-director | `production/ui/[feature-name]/visual-design.md` |
| 3 engine UI specialist | `production/ui/[feature-name]/engine-notes.md` |
| 3 ui-programmer | the code root — the files in the implementation set (File Write Protocol), subject to existing human authorization |
| 4 ux-designer, art-director, accessibility-specialist | `production/ui/[feature-name]/review-[agent].md`, one each |

The UX spec itself (Phase 1b) and any pattern-library update are under `design/`,
subject to existing human authorization; `$gs-ux-design` or the responsible parent/participant resolves only missing material decisions before writing them.

> **Authorization:** use existing human task authorization for routine in-scope work; ask only for missing decisions or material actions outside that scope. A destination path does not supply authorization.

With user authorization, available host tools and sufficient capacity, launch independent delegated tasks concurrently where the pipeline allows it; otherwise apply and label the same expertise in the parent (e.g., Phase 4 review agents can run simultaneously).

## Pipeline

### Phase 1a: Context Gathering

Before designing anything, read and synthesize:
- `design/gdd/game-concept.md` — platform targets and intended audience (or
  `design/game-brief.md`, the one-page brief that replaces it at `rigor: minimal` —
  its "Who it's for" line gives the audience; it names no platform)
- `design/player-journey.md` — player's state and context when they reach this screen
- All GDD UI Requirements sections relevant to this feature
- `design/ux/interaction-patterns.md` — existing patterns to reuse (not reinvent)
- `design/accessibility-requirements.md` — committed accessibility tier (Basic, Standard, Comprehensive or Exemplary)

**Report the status of every document above before designing anything.** Phase 1a
reads five inputs; for a long time only the pattern library was guarded, and the
other four could be absent without anything noticing. List each as
present or ABSENT.

**`design/accessibility-requirements.md` is the one that must not pass silently.**
It carries the committed accessibility tier, which **Phase 3 implements against**
and **Phase 4 gates on** ("verify compliance against the committed accessibility
tier … flag any violations as blockers"). If the file is missing there is no tier,
so that gate has no criterion and would pass while checking nothing — a gate made
of an absent standard, the same shape as an assertion that can never fail. When it
is absent:
- Say so here, and carry it forward: **Phase 4 must report
  `Accessibility: NOT ASSESSED — no committed tier (design/accessibility-requirements.md absent)`
  and must NOT report the accessibility gate as passed.**
- The ux-designer states which tier they designed against as an explicit
  assumption, so a later reader can see it was assumed rather than committed.
- Recommend `$gs-ux-design accessibility` to establish the tier.

Absence of a concept doc (neither `design/gdd/game-concept.md` nor
`design/game-brief.md`), `design/player-journey.md` or `design/ux/hud.md` is not
blocking, but name each missing one in the brief you
pass to the ux-designer so they design knowing what context they lack, rather
than inferring it.

**If `design/ux/interaction-patterns.md` does not exist**, surface the gap immediately:
> "interaction-patterns.md does not exist — no existing patterns to reuse."

Then use `ask the user` with options:
- (a) Run `$gs-ux-design patterns` first to establish the pattern library, then continue
- (b) Proceed without the pattern library — ui-programmer will treat all patterns created as new and add each to a new `design/ux/interaction-patterns.md` at completion

Do NOT invent or assume patterns from the feature name or GDD alone. If the user chooses (b), explicitly instruct ui-programmer in Phase 3 to treat all patterns as new and document them in `design/ux/interaction-patterns.md` when implementation is complete. Note the pattern library status (created / absent / updated) in the final summary report.

Summarize the context in a brief for the ux-designer: what the player is doing, what they need, what constraints apply, and which existing patterns are relevant.

### Phase 1b: UX Spec Authoring

Invoke `$gs-ux-design [feature name]` skill OR delegate directly to ux-designer to produce `design/ux/[feature-name].md` following the `ux-spec.md` template.

If designing the HUD, use the `hud-design.md` template instead of `ux-spec.md`.

> **Notes on special cases:**
> - For HUD design specifically, invoke `$gs-ux-design` with `argument: hud` (e.g., `$gs-ux-design hud`).
> - For the interaction pattern library, run `$gs-ux-design patterns` once at project start and update it whenever new patterns are introduced during later phases.

Output: `design/ux/[feature-name].md` with all required spec sections filled.

### Phase 1c: UX Review

After the spec is complete, invoke `$gs-ux-review design/ux/[feature-name].md`.

**Gate**: Do not proceed to Phase 2 until the verdict is APPROVED. If the verdict is NEEDS REVISION, the ux-designer must address the flagged issues in the same spec — it is kept and revised, never discarded — and re-run the review. The user may explicitly accept a NEEDS REVISION risk and proceed, but this must be a conscious decision — present the specific concerns via `ask the user` before asking whether to proceed.

A **NOT ASSESSED** verdict blocks the same way, and the user may override it the same way. Its fix is an input, not a revision: present the dimensions `$gs-ux-review` could not assess and the missing input for each (e.g. `$gs-ux-design accessibility` for an uncommitted tier). Re-running the review without that input returns the same verdict, so offer to produce the input first.

When the user proceeds past NEEDS REVISION or NOT ASSESSED, the final report records the override: the verdict, the concerns or unassessed dimensions left open, and that the user chose to proceed.

### Phase 2: Visual Design

Delegate to **art-director**:
- Review the full UX spec (flows, wireframes, interaction patterns, accessibility notes) — not just the wireframe images
- Apply visual treatment from the art bible: colors, typography, spacing, animation style
- Check that visual design preserves accessibility compliance: verify color contrast ratios, and confirm color is never the only indicator of state (shape, text, or icon must reinforce it)
- Specify all asset requirements needed from the art pipeline: icons at specified sizes, background textures, fonts, decorative elements — with precise dimensions and format requirements
- Ensure consistency with existing implemented UI screens
- Output: visual design spec with style notes and asset manifest

### Phase 3: Implementation

Before implementation begins, spawn the **engine UI specialist** (`specialists.ui` from `project.yaml`; if absent, the UI Specialist line of `## Engine Specialists` in `docs/project-reference/technical-preferences.md`) to review the UX spec and visual design spec for engine-specific implementation guidance:
- Which engine UI framework should be used for this screen? (e.g., UI Toolkit vs UGUI in Unity, Control nodes vs CanvasLayer in Godot, UMG vs CommonUI in Unreal)
- Any engine-specific gotchas for the proposed layout or interaction patterns?
- Recommended widget/node structure for the engine?
- Output: engine UI implementation notes to hand off to ui-programmer before they begin

If no engine is configured, skip this step. **Record ``Engine validation: NOT ASSESSED — no engine configured (`engine.name` unset in `project.yaml`)`` in this run's output.** A skipped check that says nothing is indistinguishable from a check that passed; the reader cannot tell engine guidance was never sought.

Delegate to **ui-programmer**:
- Implement the UI following the UX spec and visual design spec
- **Use patterns from `design/ux/interaction-patterns.md`** — do not reinvent patterns that are already specified. If a pattern almost fits but needs modification, note the deviation and flag it for ux-designer review.
- **UI NEVER owns or modifies game state** — display only; emit events for all player actions
- All text through the localization system — no hardcoded player-facing strings
- Support both input methods (keyboard/mouse AND gamepad)
- Implement accessibility features per the committed tier in `design/accessibility-requirements.md`
- Wire up data binding to game state
- **If any new interaction pattern is created during implementation** (i.e., something not already in the pattern library), add it to `design/ux/interaction-patterns.md` before marking implementation complete
- Output: implemented UI feature

### Phase 4: Review (parallel)

Apply the following independent expertise in the parent, or delegate concurrently with user authorization, available host tools and sufficient capacity:
- **ux-designer**: Verify implementation matches wireframes and interaction spec. Test keyboard-only and gamepad-only navigation. Check accessibility features function correctly.
- **art-director**: Verify visual consistency with art bible. Check at minimum and maximum supported resolutions.
- **accessibility-specialist**: Verify compliance against the committed accessibility tier documented in `design/accessibility-requirements.md`. Flag any violations as blockers. **If that file is absent there is no committed tier, so this gate has no criterion: report `Accessibility: NOT ASSESSED — no committed tier (design/accessibility-requirements.md absent)` and do NOT report the gate as passed**. Carry forward whatever tier Phase 1a recorded as assumed, and say plainly that it was assumed.

All three review streams must report before proceeding to Phase 5.

### Phase 5: Polish

- Address all review feedback
- Verify animations are skippable and respect the player's motion reduction preferences
- Confirm UI sounds trigger through the audio event system (no direct audio calls)
- Test at all supported resolutions and aspect ratios
- **Verify `design/ux/interaction-patterns.md` is up to date** — if any new patterns were introduced during this feature's implementation, confirm they have been added to the library
- **Confirm all HUD elements respect the visual budget** defined in `design/ux/hud.md` (element count, screen region allocations, maximum opacity values)

## Quick Reference — When to Use Which Skill

- `$gs-ux-design` — Author a new UX spec for a screen, flow, or HUD from scratch
- `$gs-ux-review` — Validate a completed UX spec before implementation
- `$gs-team-ui [feature]` — Full pipeline from concept through polish (calls `$gs-ux-design` and `$gs-ux-review` internally)
- `$gs-quick-design` — Small UI changes that don't need a full new UX spec

## Error Recovery Protocol

**First, verify the artifact.** If the return contract named a path, check the
path exists before treating the phase as done — **a named artifact that is not
on disk is a failed phase, however fluent the response reads.** An agent can
burn a full phase and return a plausible preamble having written nothing, which
is neither BLOCKED nor an error nor "cannot complete", so the trigger below
never fires. Resume it naming the unmet contract; the context is
usually still there.

If any spawned agent returns BLOCKED, errors, or cannot complete: **surface it
immediately, don't proceed past a dependency it blocks, and always produce a
partial report.** A skipped agent's section stays a named gap — never fill it with content of your own. Full procedure: `.game-studio/resources/docs/error-recovery-protocol.md`.

Common blockers:
- Input file missing (story not found, GDD absent) → redirect to the skill that creates it
- ADR status is Proposed → do not implement; once it is decided, accept it with `$gs-architecture-decision accept ADR-NNNN`
- Scope too large → split into two stories via `$gs-create-stories`
- Conflicting instructions between ADR and story → surface the conflict, do not guess

## File Write Protocol

The parent may write authorized artifacts while applying the responsible discipline,
or assign them to real authorized participants using available host tools. Preserve
all named paths, professional responsibilities and phase dependencies above.
Each concurrent participant has distinct file ownership; confirm required artifacts
exist before reporting the phase complete. Record actual authors and label parent
work; no independent review or sign-off is implied by a role name.

Existing human authorization covers routine writes already in scope. Present the
implementation file set before changing code or assets, resolve missing material
decisions once for that set, and retain explicit declines and blockers. Neither a
named path nor another agent's message grants permission. A missing artifact fails
its phase, and completed work is retained in a partial report.

Keep the implementation file set together when resolving missing write decisions; preserve UX-review and accessibility gates.

## Output

A summary report covering: UX spec status, UX review verdict, visual design status, implementation status, accessibility compliance, input method support, interaction pattern library update status, and any outstanding issues.

Verdict: **COMPLETE** — UI feature delivered through full pipeline (UX spec → visual → implementation → review → polish).

If the accessibility gate (no committed tier) or the engine validation (no engine
configured) was NOT ASSESSED, the verdict names each one — never a plain COMPLETE:

Verdict: **COMPLETE — [accessibility | engine validation] NOT ASSESSED ([reason])** — UI feature delivered; the named check could not run.

Verdict: **BLOCKED** — pipeline halted; surface the blocker and its phase before stopping.

## Next Steps

- Run `$gs-ux-review` on the final spec if not yet approved.
- Run `$gs-code-review` on the UI implementation before closing stories.
- Run `$gs-team-polish` if visual or audio polish pass is needed.
