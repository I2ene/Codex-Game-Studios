## Native checkpoint interface

Read .game-studio/resources/docs/context-management.md. Explicitly run recover
--root <project-root> and use checkpoint.path as <resolved-checkpoint>. If DISABLED,
skip checkpoint reads/writes; do not create a fixed fallback. Otherwise write the
current concise authored state to a temporary repository-local Markdown file and
run checkpoint --save <authored-file> --root <project-root>. Preserve useful fields
from the prior snapshot, reconcile current facts and replace stale state; the helper
keeps a hash-named backup. Do not append unbounded history or infer unseen work.
Existing task authorization covers routine state writes; state never grants consent.

## Project engine reference contract

When engine facts or APIs matter, explicitly run the native engine-reference command
and read .game-studio/resources/docs/engine-reference-resolution.md. <project-engine-reference> means its resolved
project.root and project.documents. Use actual project version/verification records;
missing records remain unknown. Packaged engine versions are historical background,
never project authority. Confirm current official APIs and actual toolchain before claims.

## Native execution contract

Use current project instructions, user authorization and inherited model/permissions.
Read `.game-studio/resources/docs/native-runtime.md` for platform mechanics and only
the domain references needed for this task. Config is an explicit command, not shell
preprocessing. Workflow inputs come from the user's request, not injected variables.
Tool-shaped examples below are procedural briefs; use tools actually exposed by the
host. They do not declare APIs or grant permissions. Existing task authorization
satisfies routine writes already in scope; do not repeat per-file approval questions.

Roles describe expertise. Delegate only when authorized and useful; otherwise apply
the role yourself and label the review as performed by the parent. Never fabricate
participant IDs, independent reviews or sign-off. Record real delegated participants.
Missing evidence means NOT ASSESSED — NO DATA. Resolve engine/version from this
project; engine reference versions are examples and require current verification.


# Consistency Check

Detects cross-document inconsistencies by comparing all GDDs against the
entity registry (`design/registry/entities.yaml`). Uses a grep-first approach:
reads the registry once, then targets only the GDD sections that mention
registered names — no full document reads unless a conflict needs investigation.

**This skill is the write-time safety net.** It catches what `$gs-design-system`'s
per-section checks may have missed and what `$gs-review-all-gdds`'s holistic review
catches too late.

**When to run:**
- After writing each new GDD (before moving to the next system)
- Before `$gs-review-all-gdds` (so that skill starts with a clean baseline)
- Before `$gs-create-architecture` (inconsistencies poison downstream ADRs)
- On demand: `$gs-consistency-check entity:[name]` to check one entity specifically

**Output:** Conflict report + optional registry corrections

---

Every `ask the user` call follows `.game-studio/resources/docs/automation-modes.md`
(collaborative resolves open choices · guided resolves major choices · autonomous records in-scope choices;
`automation_always_ask` categories require input only outside existing authorization).

**`workflow`** (see `.game-studio/resources/docs/workflow-modes.md`), applied per GDD at its
**effective** tier — the `system_overrides` row for that GDD's system (its
filename stem) when the block lists one, else the project value:
- `full` — full entity-registry cross-check against all GDD sections.
- `standard` — cross-check against the required sections only. The report's
  Scope line says so, and each value stated for a registered name outside those
  sections is listed as not checked at this tier (Phase 3 applies this).
- `minimal` — not meaningful (no GDDs to check).

## Phase 1: Parse Arguments and Load Registry

**Modes:**
- No argument / `full` — check all registered entries against all GDDs
- `since-last-review` — check only GDDs modified since the last review report
- `entity:<name>` — check one specific entity across all GDDs
- `item:<name>` — check one specific item across all GDDs

**Load the registry:**

```
Read path="design/registry/entities.yaml"
```

If the file does not exist or has no entries:
> "Entity registry is empty. Run `$gs-design-system` to write GDDs — the registry
> is populated automatically after each GDD is completed. Nothing to check yet."

Verdict: **NOT ASSESSED — entity registry empty**. Stop: nothing was compared,
so there is no PASS to give and nothing to write.

Build four lookup tables from the registry:
- **entity_map**: `{ name → { source, attributes, referenced_by } }`
- **item_map**: `{ name → { source, value_gold, weight, ... } }`
- **formula_map**: `{ name → { source, variables, output_range } }`
- **constant_map**: `{ name → { source, value, unit } }`

Count total registered entries. Report:
```
Registry loaded: [N] entities, [N] items, [N] formulas, [N] constants
Scope: [full | since-last-review | entity:name]
```

For `entity:<name>` or `item:<name>`, if the registry has no entry by that name
the verdict is **NOT ASSESSED — `<name>` is not in the registry**: list the
closest registered names and stop. Checking an unregistered name compares
nothing, and that is not a PASS.

---

## Phase 2: Locate In-Scope GDDs

```
Glob pattern="design/gdd/*.md"
```

Exclude the docs that live in `design/gdd/` but are not system GDDs:
`game-concept.md`, `systems-index.md`, `game-pillars.md`, `gameplay-tags.md`,
`entity-registry.md`, `fixture-swap-ledger.md`, `sound-bible.md` and any
`gdd-cross-review-*.md` (the report `$gs-review-all-gdds` writes here).

For `since-last-review` mode:
```bash
git log --name-only --pretty=format: -- design/gdd/ | grep "\.md$" | sort -u
```
Limit to GDDs modified since the most recent `design/gdd/gdd-cross-review-*.md`
file's creation date.

Report the in-scope GDD list before scanning. **If the list is empty** — no system
GDDs exist, or `since-last-review` found none changed — the verdict is
**NOT ASSESSED — no GDDs in scope**: say which filter produced zero, and stop.
A scan of nothing finds no conflicts, and that is not a PASS.

---

## Phase 3: Grep-First Conflict Scan

For each registered entry, grep every in-scope GDD for the entry's name.
Do NOT do full reads — extract only the matching lines and their immediate
context (-C 3 lines).

This is the core optimization: instead of reading 10 GDDs × 400 lines each
(4,000 lines), you grep 50 entity names × 10 GDDs (50 targeted searches,
each returning ~10 lines on a hit).

**In a GDD whose effective tier is `standard`, compare only hits under a
required section.** The effective tier is per GDD: `system_overrides.<stem>`
replaces the project tier for that GDD in either direction (a `full` row makes
every section compared). Grep each such GDD once for `^## ` to get its headings
and line numbers, and file every name hit under the nearest heading above it:
only hits under Overview, Detailed Rules / Detailed Design, Formulas, Edge
Cases, Dependencies or Acceptance Criteria are compared — plus Tuning Knobs when
`project.yaml` sets `workflow_overrides.tuning_knobs: true` (read that flag
once; it only ever adds the section). Any other hit (Tuning Knobs without the
flag, Player Fantasy, any other section) raises no finding and is not logged;
list each one that states a value (name, GDD, section) on the report's
`Not checked at this tier` line.

### 3a: Entity Scan

For each entity in entity_map:

```
Grep pattern="[entity_name]" glob="design/gdd/*.md" output_mode="content" -C 3
```

For each GDD hit, extract the values mentioned near the entity name:
- any numeric attributes (counts, costs, durations, ranges, rates)
- any categorical attributes (types, tiers, categories)
- any derived values (totals, outputs, results)
- any other attributes registered in entity_map

Compare extracted values against the registry entry.

**Conflict detection:**
- Registry says `[entity_name].[attribute] = [value_A]`. GDD says `[entity_name] has [value_B]`. → **CONFLICT**
- Registry says `[item_name].[attribute] = [value_A]`. GDD says `[item_name] is [value_B]`. → **CONFLICT**
- GDD mentions `[entity_name]` but doesn't specify the attribute. → **NOTE** (no conflict, just unverifiable)

### 3b: Item Scan

For each item in item_map, grep all GDDs for the item name. Extract:
- sell price / value / gold value
- weight
- stack rules (stackable / non-stackable)
- category

Compare against registry entry values.

### 3c: Formula Scan

For each formula in formula_map, grep all GDDs for the formula name. Extract:
- variable names mentioned near the formula
- output range or cap values mentioned

Compare against registry entry:
- Different variable names → **CONFLICT**
- Output range stated differently → **CONFLICT**

### 3d: Constant Scan

For each constant in constant_map, grep all GDDs for the constant name. Extract:
- Any numeric value mentioned near the constant name

Compare against registry value:
- Different number → **CONFLICT**

---

## Phase 4: Deep Investigation (Conflicts Only)

For each conflict found in Phase 3, do a targeted full-section read of the
conflicting GDD to get precise context:

```
Read path="design/gdd/[conflicting_gdd].md"
```
(Or use Grep with wider context if the file is large)

Confirm the conflict with full context. Determine:
1. **Which GDD is correct?** Check the `source:` field in the registry — the
   source GDD is the authoritative owner. Any other GDD that contradicts it
   is the one that needs updating.
2. **Is the registry itself out of date?** If the source GDD was updated after
   the registry entry was written (check git log), the registry may be stale.
3. **Is this a genuine design change?** If the conflict represents an intentional
   design decision, the resolution is: update the source GDD, update the registry,
   then fix all other GDDs.

For each conflict, classify:
- **🔴 CONFLICT** — same named entity/item/formula/constant with different values
  in different GDDs. Must resolve before architecture begins.
- **⚠️ STALE REGISTRY** — source GDD value changed but registry not updated.
  Registry needs updating; other GDDs may be correct already.
- **ℹ️ UNVERIFIABLE** — entity mentioned but no comparable attribute stated.
  Not a conflict; just noting the reference.

---

## Phase 5: Output Report

```
## Consistency Check Report
Date: [date]
Registry entries checked: [N entities, N items, N formulas, N constants]
GDDs scanned: [N] ([list names])
Scope: [all GDD sections | required sections only — workflow: standard | per GDD — name each GDD whose effective tier differs, and its tier]
Not checked at this tier: [each value stated outside the required sections (name, GDD, section) — or "none"; omit when every GDD is at `full`]

---

### Conflicts Found (must resolve before architecture)

🔴 [Entity/Item/Formula/Constant Name]
   Registry (source: [gdd]): [attribute] = [value]
   Conflict in [other_gdd].md: [attribute] = [different_value]
   → Resolution needed: [which doc to change and to what]

---

### Stale Registry Entries (registry behind the GDD)

⚠️ [Entry Name]
   Registry says: [value] (written [date])
   Source GDD now says: [new value]
   → Update registry entry to match source GDD, then check referenced_by docs.

---

### Unverifiable References (no conflict, informational)

ℹ️ [gdd].md mentions [entity_name] but states no comparable attributes.
   No conflict detected. No action required.

---

### Clean Entries (no issues found)

✅ [N] registry entries verified across all GDDs with no conflicts.

---

Verdict: PASS | CONFLICTS FOUND | NOT ASSESSED
```

**Verdict:**
- **CONFLICTS FOUND** — one or more conflicts detected. List resolution steps.
- **NOT ASSESSED** — nothing was compared: the entity registry is empty or the
  named entity is not in it (Phase 1), or no GDDs were in scope (Phase 2). Say
  which.
- **PASS** — no conflicts. Registry and GDDs agree on all checked values, across at least one GDD.

---

## Phase 6: Registry Corrections

If stale registry entries were found, ask:
> "May I update `design/registry/entities.yaml` to fix the [N] stale entries?"

For each stale entry:
- Update the `value` / attribute field
- Set `revised:` to today's date
- Add a YAML comment with the old value: `# was: [old_value] before [date]`

If new entries were found in GDDs that are not in the registry, ask:
> "Found [N] entities/items mentioned in GDDs that aren't in the registry yet.
> May I add them to `design/registry/entities.yaml`?"

Only add entries that appear in more than one GDD (true cross-system facts).

**Never delete registry entries.** Set `status: deprecated` if an entry is removed
from all GDDs.

After writing: Verdict: **COMPLETE** — consistency check finished.
If conflicts remain unresolved: Verdict: **BLOCKED** — [N] conflicts need manual resolution before architecture begins.

### 6b: Append to Reflexion Log

If any 🔴 CONFLICT entries were found (regardless of whether they were resolved),
ask: "May I append [N] entries to `docs/consistency-failures.md` (creating it if
absent)?" On yes, append an entry for each conflict; on no, say the conflicts
were not logged.

```markdown
### [YYYY-MM-DD] — $gs-consistency-check — 🔴 CONFLICT
**Domain**: [system domain(s) involved]
**Documents involved**: [source GDD] vs [conflicting GDD]
**What happened**: [specific conflict — entity name, attribute, differing values]
**Resolution**: [how it was fixed, or "Unresolved — manual action needed"]
**Pattern**: [generalised lesson, e.g. "Item values defined in combat GDD were not
referenced in economy GDD before authoring — always check entities.yaml first"]
```

If `docs/consistency-failures.md` does not exist, create it with this header before appending:

```markdown
# Consistency Failure Log

<!-- Auto-maintained by $gs-consistency-check. Do not edit manually. -->
<!-- One entry per detected conflict, in chronological order. -->

| Date | GDD A | GDD B | Conflict Type | Status |
|------|-------|-------|---------------|--------|
```

Then append the new conflict entries. Never skip logging on your own — a missing file is not a reason to lose conflict history; only the user's "no" is.

---

## Phase 7: Session State and Closing

Save the current authored snapshot through checkpoint --save to `<resolved-checkpoint>` (create the file if it does not exist):

```
<!-- CONSISTENCY-CHECK: [date] | GDDs checked: [N] | Conflicts found: [N] | Log: docs/consistency-failures.md -->
```

> **Point at `docs/consistency-failures.md` — the file Phase 6 actually appends
> to.** A breadcrumb is a pointer left for a future session to follow. One that
> names a file nothing writes sends that session looking for conflict history it
> will never find, and nothing errors along the way. Never invent a report
> filename here.

Then close with an `ask the user` widget:

- **Prompt**: "Consistency check complete — [N] conflicts found. What next?"
- **Options**:
  - `[A] Fix the highest-priority conflict now`
  - `[B] Run $gs-design-review on the most conflicted GDD`
  - `[C] Stop here`

In collaborative and guided modes, never end the skill with plain text — always
close with this widget. In autonomous mode, print the findings and recommended
next step, then record via an authored decision record (not a tool or shell function) (no widget).

---

## Recovery / Reference

- **If PASS**: Run `$gs-review-all-gdds` for holistic design-theory review, or
  `$gs-create-architecture` if all MVP GDDs are complete.
- **If CONFLICTS FOUND**: Fix the flagged GDDs, then re-run
  `$gs-consistency-check` to confirm resolution.
- **If STALE REGISTRY**: Update the registry (Phase 6), then re-run to verify.
- Run `$gs-consistency-check` after writing each new GDD to catch issues early,
  not at architecture time.
