# $gs-dev-story — Handoff Contract

## Role in Pipeline
Bridges planning and code by loading the full context for a single story (story file, TR registry, ADR, control manifest, engine prefs), routing to the correct programmer agent, implementing source code and tests, and leaving the story ready for `$gs-story-done` (with `$gs-code-review` first at `standard`/`full`).

## Inputs Required

### Files That Must Exist
| File | Required Fields / Sections | Read-Only? |
|------|---------------------------|-----------|
| `production/epics/**/*.md` (the story file) | `Status: Ready`, `TR-ID`, `Governing ADR`, `Manifest Version`, `## Acceptance Criteria`, `## Test Evidence`, `## Dependencies`, `## Out of Scope` | **Partially mutable.** This skill sets `Status:` to `In Progress` and updates `Last Updated:` before implementation starts (Phase 3), and at the end preserves the planned list and records actual changes in `## Files` — at `minimal` the story file is the only record of progress, since `sprint-status.yaml` is absent. On an ADR version mismatch answered "Re-read the changed ADR" it sets `ADR Version` to the ADR's current version and refreshes `**ADR Decision Summary**` and `## Implementation Notes`; on a manifest mismatch answered "Update" it sets `Manifest Version:` to the actual current version; "Use the old rules" retains the old stamp and records the current version plus accepted risk in `Manifest-Note:`. Everything else in the story file is read-only to this skill |
| `docs/architecture/tr-registry.yaml` | Entry matching the story's TR-ID with current `requirement` text | Yes |
| `docs/architecture/adr-NNNN-[slug].md` (referenced ADR) | `## Status`, `## Last Verified` (else `## Date`) — from `adr-status.sh`; `## Decision` (with its `### Implementation Guidelines`), `## Engine Compatibility`, `## ADR Dependencies` — read only on a version mismatch answered "Re-read the changed ADR" | Yes — the ADR is never edited; a mismatch updates the story's stamp, not the ADR |
| `docs/architecture/control-manifest.md` | `Manifest Version:` header, layer rules (required patterns, forbidden patterns, performance guardrails) | Yes |
| `project.yaml` | `engine.name`, `engine.version`, `naming.*`, `performance.*` — the primary source for each of these fields | Yes |
| `.game-studio/resources/docs/technical-preferences.md` | Legacy fallback for any field above that is absent or empty in `project.yaml`; **sole** source for forbidden patterns and allowed libraries (deliberately never migrated), plus the `Engine Specialists` section | Yes — required only for fields absent from `project.yaml`, and always for forbidden patterns |
| `<project-engine-reference>/VERSION.md` | Engine version, LLM knowledge cutoff, post-cutoff risk levels | Yes |
| `<resolved-checkpoint>` | (read to find active story when no argument given; read only when checkpoint recovery is enabled) | No |

> **Tier.** SKILL.md Phase 2 decides by `workflow`: the TR registry is required at
> `full`, optional at `standard` and not expected at `minimal`; a missing control
> manifest warns at `full`/`standard` and is not expected at `minimal`; an ADR
> blocks when the story references one that is missing, `Proposed`, `Deprecated`
> or `Superseded`.

### Preconditions
- The target story must have `Status: Ready` (validated by `$gs-story-readiness` at `standard`/`full`; at `minimal`, `$gs-create-stories` writes stories `Ready` and `$gs-story-readiness` is not on the path)
- The ADR referenced in the story must have `Status: Accepted` — if `Status: Proposed`, do not implement; surface this as a blocker and direct user to `$gs-architecture-decision accept [ADR-id]`; `Deprecated` or `Superseded` also blocks, naming the successor. A story whose ADR field reads `N/A` references none, at every tier
- All `## Dependencies` stories listed in the story file must already have `Status: Complete` (or `Status: Done`)
- An engine must be configured — `engine.name` in `project.yaml`, or as legacy fallback an `**Engine**:` value in `.game-studio/resources/docs/technical-preferences.md` that is not `[TO BE CONFIGURED]`
- At `full`, `docs/architecture/tr-registry.yaml` must contain the story's TR-ID (optional at `standard`, not expected at `minimal`)
- `docs/architecture/control-manifest.md` supplies the layer rules when present; a missing one warns and never stops the skill

## Outputs Produced

### Files Written
| File | Guaranteed Fields / Sections | Notes |
|------|------------------------------|-------|
| `<code root>/[system]/[file].[ext]` | Doc-commented public APIs; no hardcoded gameplay values; follows ADR Implementation Guidelines and control-manifest required patterns | created or modified by the parent or authorized programmer participant; code root resolved per `.game-studio/resources/docs/code-root-resolution.md` |
| `tests/unit/[system]/[story-slug]_test.[ext]` OR `tests/integration/[system]/[story-slug]_test.[ext]` | One test function per acceptance criterion (Logic/Integration stories only); naming per engine (`.game-studio/resources/rules/test-standards.md`); no random seeds; no external I/O | created by the parent or authorized programmer participant; path matches `## Test Evidence` in story |
| The story file's `## Files` section | The planned code and test files plus the actual paths changed, one per line in each subsection | replaced through the native `markdown replace` command (the section is added at the end when the story has none); named in the one In Progress ask, skipped when that ask is declined. `$gs-story-done` checks scope against it |
| `<resolved-checkpoint>` | `<!-- CHECKPOINT -->` block: current task (story path), next step, blocker, files in progress, run result | written on each outcome only when checkpoint recovery is enabled, using `checkpoint --save <authored-file> --root <project-root>`: the block is replaced, never appended (DISABLED means no checkpoint file is created) |

### Output Guarantees
- All source files follow the naming conventions in `project.yaml` (`naming.*`), falling back to `.game-studio/resources/docs/technical-preferences.md` for any convention absent there
- Test file path matches exactly the path declared in the story's `## Test Evidence` section
- Every acceptance criterion is mapped to a test function (Logic/Integration), an `OBSERVED` retained screenshot (the *look* half of Visual/Feel and UI), or flagged `DEFERRED` (the *feel* half only — timing, weight, responsiveness) in the implementation summary
- No files are written outside the story's `## Out of Scope` boundary without surfacing the conflict to the user first
- Session state records files changed and the next recommended invocation (`$gs-story-done`; `$gs-code-review` first at `standard`/`full`) — on INCOMPLETE, `$gs-dev-story` to resume; on BLOCKED, the unblocking action
- The implementation summary states a **verification** result — what was run against the written code (Godot: `.game-studio/scripts/godot-parse-check.gd` over the changed scripts; Unity: `commands.smoke`; Unreal: the editor-target build) and its exit code. When the engine binary is unavailable this is **`NOT VERIFIED — <reason>`**, never an inference that the code is fine because it reads correctly
- The implementation summary states a **run result** — `OBSERVED — <what was on screen>` with a retained screenshot under `production/qa/evidence/[story-slug]/`, `NOT VERIFIED — <reason>`, or `N/A — <reason>` (only for a story with genuinely nothing observable). `NOT VERIFIED` is a blocker at the default gate level for Visual/Feel and UI stories. The run is **not waived at `qa.level: minimal`** — tests are, the look is not. Procedure: `.game-studio/resources/docs/run-and-observe.md`
- At `qa.level: minimal` no test file is written, and for a Logic or Integration story the summary says so explicitly (`Test evidence: waived at qa.level: minimal`); UI and Visual/Feel stories get no waiver line, because their screenshot still applies. A waived run and a run where tests were forgotten must not produce the same artifact
- **`NOT ASSESSED` is an accepted inbound value of the story's `Risk` field** (`$gs-create-stories` emits it when `VERSION.md` assigns no level). The engine specialist checks every code story, so no Risk value can skip that check
- **Completion is not assumed.** If the programmer agent stopped early or its output fails to parse, the story is reported **INCOMPLETE** with the specific breakage named, and `Implementation Complete` is not emitted

## Immutability Rules
- READS but does NOT modify: `project.yaml`, `docs/architecture/tr-registry.yaml`, `docs/architecture/adr-NNNN-[slug].md`, all GDD files in `design/gdd/`, `docs/architecture/control-manifest.md`, `.game-studio/resources/docs/technical-preferences.md` (legacy fallback), `<project-engine-reference>/VERSION.md`
- MODIFIES through parent programmer expertise or actual authorized delegates: `<code root>/**` (new/updated source files; code root resolved per `.game-studio/resources/docs/code-root-resolution.md`) and the engine's test root (the new test file; `tests/` on Godot)
- MODIFIES within existing authorization; ask for unresolved material decisions or out-of-scope writes: the story file's `Status:`, `Last Updated:`, `## Files`, `ADR Version`, `**ADR Decision Summary**`, `## Implementation Notes`, `Manifest Version:` and `Manifest-Note:` (see the story row above); the story's entry in `production/sprint-status.yaml` (`status: in-progress`, top-level `updated`); a dependency story's `Status:` (that dependency answer only); a Config/Data story's data file; on Unity, `Assets/Scripts/ScreenshotOnArg.cs`, written verbatim from `.game-studio/resources/docs/run-and-observe.md` when the project has none
- MODIFIES within existing authorization, only when checkpoint recovery enables it: `<resolved-checkpoint>` — its `<!-- CHECKPOINT -->` block is overwritten, never appended
- Sets the story file's own `Status` field to `In Progress` only (Phase 3, before
  implementation starts). Closing the story being implemented is the exclusive
  responsibility of `$gs-story-done`; the one other `Status` this skill writes is a
  dependency's `Complete` under that dependency answer (Hard Constraints)

## Hard Constraints (Never Violate)
- Never marks a story `Status: Done` or `Status: Complete` on its own judgement — that belongs to `$gs-story-done`. The one exception is a dependency the user states is already done (the Phase 2 dependency answer "It is done, the status was never updated"): its `Status` is set to `Complete` only after "May I update [dependency path] Status to Complete?" is approved
- Never begins implementation without loading the full context package (story, TR-ID from registry, ADR Decision + Implementation Guidelines — as distilled in the story, or re-read from the ADR after that mismatch answer — control-manifest layer rules, engine prefs)
- Never implements a story whose referenced ADR has `Status: Proposed`, `Deprecated` or `Superseded` — surface as a blocker
- Never writes a Logic or Integration story as complete without a test file at the path declared in `## Test Evidence`
- Never touches files listed in the story's `## Out of Scope` section without explicit user approval
- Never deviates from the ADR's Implementation Guidelines silently — deviations must be flagged in the summary
- Never modifies ADR files or GDD files under any circumstances
- Source and test files are written by the parent applying programmer expertise or by authorized delegates; the capture exception is the verbatim `ScreenshotOnArg.cs` capture script on Unity, after an ask

## Downstream Skill Expects
**Next skill:** `$gs-story-done`
- It will read: the story file (to check `Status`, `## Acceptance Criteria`, `## Test Evidence` path, `Type:`, referenced ADR, TR-ID)
- It assumes: the test file declared in `## Test Evidence` already exists on disk (for Logic/Integration stories)
- It assumes: `<resolved-checkpoint>` records the story path and files changed (used to locate the in-progress story when no argument is given)
- It assumes: source files under the resolved code root are present and match the criterion descriptions, so Grep-based deviation checks can run

## Known Fragile Points
- If the story's embedded `Manifest Version` differs from the current `docs/architecture/control-manifest.md` header date, rules may have changed since the story was authored — the skill surfaces this, but silently proceeding would produce code that violates newer manifest rules
- The test file path in `## Test Evidence` must be exact: `$gs-story-done` uses that literal path for Glob checks; a typo here causes a false BLOCKING result downstream
- If `docs/architecture/tr-registry.yaml` has a stale `requirement` text that diverges from the GDD, the implementation may satisfy the registry but fail the GDD — always treat the registry as authoritative per design, but flag if a visible discrepancy is noticed
- Report incomplete implementation and partial artifacts. The parent may resume authorized work, but closing cannot infer a completed file or test
- Config/Data stories produce no test file; `$gs-story-done` must see `Type: Config/Data` in the story header to classify the story correctly — otherwise it resolves the test-evidence gate for the wrong type (e.g. Logic, which is BLOCKING by default) and may flag a missing test
