## Project engine reference contract

When engine facts or APIs matter, explicitly run the native engine-reference command
and read .game-studio/resources/docs/engine-reference-resolution.md. <project-engine-reference> means its resolved
project.root and project.documents. Use actual project version/verification records;
missing records remain unknown. Packaged engine versions are historical background,
never project authority. Confirm current official APIs and actual toolchain before claims.

> Gate definition. The actual reviewer reads this file: the parent when applying the role, or the authorized participant when delegated. Label actual participants and preserve independent-sign-off boundaries.

# QL-TEST-COVERAGE — QA Lead Test Coverage Review

Agent: `qa-lead` | Responsibility tier: session (inherit)

**Trigger**: After implementation stories are complete — `$gs-story-done` runs it for
each story before marking it Complete

**Context to pass**:
- List of implemented stories with story types (Logic / Integration / Visual / UI / Config)
- Test file paths in `tests/`
- GDD acceptance criteria for the system

**Prompt**:
> "Review the test coverage for these implementation stories. Are all Logic stories
> covered by passing unit tests? Are Integration stories covered by integration
> tests or documented playtests? Are the GDD acceptance criteria each mapped to at
> least one test? Are there untested edge cases from the GDD Edge Cases section?
> Return ADEQUATE (coverage meets standards), GAPS [specific missing tests], or
> INADEQUATE [critical logic is untested — do not advance]."

**Verdicts**: ADEQUATE / GAPS / INADEQUATE
