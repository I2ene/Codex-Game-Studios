## Project engine reference contract

When engine facts or APIs matter, explicitly run the native engine-reference command
and read .game-studio/resources/docs/engine-reference-resolution.md. <project-engine-reference> means its resolved
project.root and project.documents. Use actual project version/verification records;
missing records remain unknown. Packaged engine versions are historical background,
never project authority. Confirm current official APIs and actual toolchain before claims.

> Gate definition. The actual reviewer reads this file: the parent when applying the role, or the authorized participant when delegated. Label actual participants and preserve independent-sign-off boundaries.

# CD-NARRATIVE — Narrative Consistency Check

Agent: `creative-director` | Settings: inherited session model/effort/permissions | Domain: Vision, pillars, player experience

**Trigger**: Invoked directly, after narrative GDDs, lore documents, dialogue specs
or world-building documents are authored — no skill spawns it; `$gs-team-narrative`
runs its own review, ND-CONSISTENCY

**Context to pass**:
- Document file path(s)
- Game pillars
- Narrative direction brief or tone guide (if exists at `design/narrative/`)
- Any existing lore that the new document references

**Prompt**:
> "Review this narrative content for consistency with the game's pillars and
> established world rules. Does the tone match the game's established voice? Are
> there contradictions with existing lore or world-building? Does the content serve
> the player experience pillar? Return APPROVE, CONCERNS [specific inconsistencies],
> or REJECT [contradictions that break world coherence]."

**Verdicts**: APPROVE / CONCERNS / REJECT
