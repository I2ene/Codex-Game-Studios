## Project engine reference contract

When engine facts or APIs matter, explicitly run the native engine-reference command
and read .game-studio/resources/docs/engine-reference-resolution.md. <project-engine-reference> means its resolved
project.root and project.documents. Use actual project version/verification records;
missing records remain unknown. Packaged engine versions are historical background,
never project authority. Confirm current official APIs and actual toolchain before claims.

> Gate definition. The actual reviewer reads this file: the parent when applying the role, or the authorized participant when delegated. Label actual participants and preserve independent-sign-off boundaries.

# ND-CONSISTENCY — Narrative Director Consistency Check

Agent: `narrative-director` | Responsibility tier: session (inherit)

**Trigger**: After writer deliverables (dialogue, lore, item descriptions) are
authored, or when a design decision has narrative implications

**Context to pass**:
- Document or content file path(s)
- Narrative bible or tone guide path (if exists)
- Relevant world-building rules
- Character or faction profiles affected

**Prompt**:
> "Review this narrative content for internal consistency and adherence to
> established world rules. Are character voices consistent with their established
> profiles? Does the lore contradict any established facts? Is the tone consistent
> with the game's narrative direction? Return APPROVE, CONCERNS [specific
> inconsistencies to fix], or REJECT [contradictions that break the narrative
> foundation]."

**Verdicts**: APPROVE / CONCERNS / REJECT
