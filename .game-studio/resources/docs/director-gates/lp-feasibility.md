## Project engine reference contract

When engine facts or APIs matter, explicitly run the native engine-reference command
and read .game-studio/resources/docs/engine-reference-resolution.md. <project-engine-reference> means its resolved
project.root and project.documents. Use actual project version/verification records;
missing records remain unknown. Packaged engine versions are historical background,
never project authority. Confirm current official APIs and actual toolchain before claims.

> Gate definition. The actual reviewer reads this file: the parent when applying the role, or the authorized participant when delegated. Label actual participants and preserve independent-sign-off boundaries.

# LP-FEASIBILITY — Lead Programmer Implementation Feasibility

Agent: `lead-programmer` | Settings: inherited session model/effort/permissions (Tier 2 lead — invoked when a domain specialist's feasibility sign-off is needed)

**Trigger**: After the master architecture document is written (`$gs-create-architecture`
Phase 7b), or when a new architectural pattern is proposed

**Context to pass**:
- Architecture document path
- Technical requirements baseline summary
- ADR list with statuses

**Prompt**:
> "Review this architecture for implementation feasibility. Flag: (a) any decisions
> that would be difficult or impossible to implement with the stated engine and
> language, (b) any missing interface definitions that programmers would need to
> invent themselves, (c) any patterns that create avoidable technical debt or
> that contradict standard [engine] idioms. Return FEASIBLE, CONCERNS [list], or
> INFEASIBLE [blockers that make this architecture unimplementable as written]."

**Verdicts**: FEASIBLE / CONCERNS / INFEASIBLE
