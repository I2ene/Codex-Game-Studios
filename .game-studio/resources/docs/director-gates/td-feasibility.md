## Project engine reference contract

When engine facts or APIs matter, explicitly run the native engine-reference command
and read .game-studio/resources/docs/engine-reference-resolution.md. <project-engine-reference> means its resolved
project.root and project.documents. Use actual project version/verification records;
missing records remain unknown. Packaged engine versions are historical background,
never project authority. Confirm current official APIs and actual toolchain before claims.

> Gate definition. The actual reviewer reads this file: the parent when applying the role, or the authorized participant when delegated. Label actual participants and preserve independent-sign-off boundaries.

# TD-FEASIBILITY — Technical Feasibility Assessment

Agent: `technical-director` | Settings: inherited session model/effort/permissions | Domain: Architecture, engine risk, performance

**Trigger**: After biggest technical risks are identified during scope/feasibility
(brainstorm Phase 6, or any early-stage concept with technical unknowns)

**Context to pass**:
- Concept's core loop description
- Platform target
- Engine choice (or "undecided")
- List of identified technical risks

**Prompt**:
> "Review these technical risks for a [genre] game targeting [platform] using
> [engine or 'undecided engine']. Flag any HIGH risk items that could invalidate
> the concept as described, any risks that are engine-specific and should influence
> the engine choice, and any risks that are commonly underestimated by solo
> developers. Return VIABLE (risks are manageable), CONCERNS [list with mitigation
> suggestions], or HIGH RISK [blockers that require concept or scope revision]."

**Verdicts**: VIABLE / CONCERNS / HIGH RISK
