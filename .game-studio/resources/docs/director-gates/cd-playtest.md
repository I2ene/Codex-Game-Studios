## Project engine reference contract

When engine facts or APIs matter, explicitly run the native engine-reference command
and read .game-studio/resources/docs/engine-reference-resolution.md. <project-engine-reference> means its resolved
project.root and project.documents. Use actual project version/verification records;
missing records remain unknown. Packaged engine versions are historical background,
never project authority. Confirm current official APIs and actual toolchain before claims.

> Gate definition. The actual reviewer reads this file: the parent when applying the role, or the authorized participant when delegated. Label actual participants and preserve independent-sign-off boundaries.

# CD-PLAYTEST — Player Experience Validation

Agent: `creative-director` | Settings: inherited session model/effort/permissions | Domain: Vision, pillars, player experience

**Trigger**: After playtest reports are generated (`$gs-playtest-report`), or after
any session that produces player feedback

**Context to pass**:
- Playtest report — its file path, or its content inline when the calling skill
  reviews before saving (`$gs-playtest-report` does)
- Game pillars and core fantasy statement
- The specific hypothesis being tested

**Prompt**:
> "Review this playtest report against the game's design pillars and core fantasy.
> Is the player experience matching the intended fantasy? Are there systematic issues
> that represent pillar drift — mechanics that feel fine in isolation but undermine
> the intended experience? Return APPROVE (core fantasy is landing), CONCERNS [gaps
> between intended and actual experience], or REJECT [core fantasy is not present —
> redesign needed before further playtesting]."

**Verdicts**: APPROVE / CONCERNS / REJECT
