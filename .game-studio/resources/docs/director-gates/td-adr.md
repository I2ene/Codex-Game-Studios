## Project engine reference contract

When engine facts or APIs matter, explicitly run the native engine-reference command
and read .game-studio/resources/docs/engine-reference-resolution.md. <project-engine-reference> means its resolved
project.root and project.documents. Use actual project version/verification records;
missing records remain unknown. Packaged engine versions are historical background,
never project authority. Confirm current official APIs and actual toolchain before claims.

> Gate definition. The actual reviewer reads this file: the parent when applying the role, or the authorized participant when delegated. Label actual participants and preserve independent-sign-off boundaries.

# TD-ADR — Architecture Decision Review

Agent: `technical-director` | Settings: inherited session model/effort/permissions | Domain: Architecture, engine risk, performance

**Trigger**: After an individual ADR is authored (`$gs-architecture-decision`), before
it is marked Accepted

**Context to pass**:
- ADR file path
- Engine version and knowledge gap risk level for the domain
- Related ADRs (if any)

**Prompt**:
> "Review this Architecture Decision Record. Does it have a clear problem statement
> and rationale? Are the rejected alternatives genuinely considered? Does the
> Consequences section acknowledge the trade-offs honestly? Is the engine version
> stamped? Are post-cutoff API risks flagged? Does it link to the GDD requirements
> it covers? Return APPROVE, CONCERNS [specific gaps], or REJECT [the decision is
> underspecified or makes unsound technical assumptions]."

**Verdicts**: APPROVE / CONCERNS / REJECT
