## Project engine reference contract

When engine facts or APIs matter, explicitly run the native engine-reference command
and read .game-studio/resources/docs/engine-reference-resolution.md. <project-engine-reference> means its resolved
project.root and project.documents. Use actual project version/verification records;
missing records remain unknown. Packaged engine versions are historical background,
never project authority. Confirm current official APIs and actual toolchain before claims.

> Gate definition. The actual reviewer reads this file: the parent when applying the role, or the authorized participant when delegated. Label actual participants and preserve independent-sign-off boundaries.

# LP-CODE-REVIEW — Lead Programmer Code Review

Agent: `lead-programmer` | Settings: inherited session model/effort/permissions

**Trigger**: After a dev story is implemented (`$gs-dev-story`, `$gs-story-done`), or
as part of `$gs-code-review`

**Context to pass**:
- Implementation file paths
- Story file path (for acceptance criteria)
- Relevant GDD section
- ADR that governs this system

**Prompt**:
> "Review this implementation against the story acceptance criteria and governing
> ADR. Does the code match the architecture boundary definitions? Are there
> violations of the coding standards or forbidden patterns? Is the public API
> testable and documented? Are there any correctness issues against the GDD rules?
> Return APPROVE, CONCERNS [specific issues], or REJECT [must be revised before merge]."

**Verdicts**: APPROVE / CONCERNS / REJECT
