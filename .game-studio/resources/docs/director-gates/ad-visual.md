## Project engine reference contract

When engine facts or APIs matter, explicitly run the native engine-reference command
and read .game-studio/resources/docs/engine-reference-resolution.md. <project-engine-reference> means its resolved
project.root and project.documents. Use actual project version/verification records;
missing records remain unknown. Packaged engine versions are historical background,
never project authority. Confirm current official APIs and actual toolchain before claims.

> Gate definition. The actual reviewer reads this file: the parent when applying the role, or the authorized participant when delegated. Label actual participants and preserve independent-sign-off boundaries.

# AD-VISUAL — Art Director Visual Consistency Review

Agent: `art-director` | Responsibility tier: session (inherit)

**Trigger**: After art direction decisions are made, when new asset types are
introduced, or when a tech art decision affects visual style

**Context to pass**:
- Art bible path (if exists at `design/art/art-bible.md`)
- The specific asset type, style decision, or visual direction being reviewed
- Reference images or style descriptions
- Platform and performance constraints

**Prompt**:
> "Review this visual direction decision for consistency with the established art
> style and production constraints. Does it match the art bible? Is it achievable
> within the platform's performance budget? Are there asset pipeline implications
> that create technical risk? Return APPROVE, CONCERNS [specific adjustments], or
> REJECT [style violation or production risk that must be resolved first]."

**Verdicts**: APPROVE / CONCERNS / REJECT
