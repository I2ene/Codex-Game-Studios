# Agent Coordination Rules

1. **Vertical Delegation**: Leadership agents delegate to department leads, who
   delegate to specialists. Never skip a tier for complex decisions.
2. **Horizontal Consultation**: Agents at the same tier may consult each other
   but must not make binding decisions outside their domain.
3. **Conflict Resolution**: When two agents disagree, escalate to the shared
   parent. If no shared parent, escalate to `creative-director` for design
   conflicts or `technical-director` for technical conflicts.
4. **Change Propagation**: When a design change affects multiple domains, the
   `producer` agent coordinates the propagation.
5. **No Unilateral Cross-Domain Changes**: An agent must never modify files
   outside its designated directories without explicit delegation.

## Model Tier Assignment

Read `.game-studio/resources/docs/model-tiers.md` on demand. It carries the tier table, the
per-skill assignments and the authoring rule.

**Load-bearing enough to restate here:** whether a skill's `model:` is used
depends on how the skill starts. Typed as `/skill-name`: yes, except a `inherited model`
pin in auto mode. Started by Claude through the Skill tool: no. Never tell a
user a `inherited model` skill saves money; an `inherited model` skill typed in a inherited model session
costs more. The agent-side `model:` is a different mechanism, and is applied.

## Subagents vs Agent Teams

This project uses two distinct multi-agent patterns:

### Subagents (current, always active)
Spawned via the available native delegation tool within a single Codex session (renamed from
`Task` in Codex 2.1.63; `Task` still works as an alias). Used by all
`team-*` skills and orchestration skills. Subagents share the session's
permission context, run sequentially or in parallel within the session, and
return results to the parent.

**When to spawn in parallel**: If two subagents' inputs are independent (neither
needs the other's output to begin), spawn both native delegation when authorized calls simultaneously
rather than waiting. Example: `$gs-review-all-gdds` **Phase 2** (consistency) and
**Phase 3** (design theory) are independent — spawn both at the same time.
Phase 1 loads the GDDs and both depend on it, so it is the one phase here that
must NOT be parallelised.

### Agent Teams (experimental — opt-in)
Multiple independent Codex *sessions* coordinated via a shared task list.
Opt-in and never yet used here — read `.game-studio/resources/docs/agent-teams.md` on demand
before proposing one.

## Parallel Task Protocol

When an orchestration skill spawns multiple independent agents:

1. Issue all independent native delegation when authorized calls before waiting for any result
2. Collect all results before proceeding to dependent phases
3. If any agent is BLOCKED, surface it immediately — do not silently skip
4. Always produce a partial report if some agents complete and others block
