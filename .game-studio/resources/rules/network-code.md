## Project engine reference contract

When engine facts or APIs matter, explicitly run the native engine-reference command
and read .game-studio/resources/docs/engine-reference-resolution.md. <project-engine-reference> means its resolved
project.root and project.documents. Use actual project version/verification records;
missing records remain unknown. Packaged engine versions are historical background,
never project authority. Confirm current official APIs and actual toolchain before claims.

# Network Code Rules

- Server is AUTHORITATIVE for all gameplay-critical state — never trust the client
- All network messages must be versioned for forward/backward compatibility
- Client predicts locally, reconciles with server — implement rollback for mispredictions
- Handle disconnection, reconnection, and host migration gracefully
- Rate-limit all network logging to prevent log flooding
- All networked values must specify replication strategy: reliable/unreliable, frequency, interpolation
- Bandwidth budget: define and track per-message-type bandwidth usage
- Security: validate all incoming packet sizes and field ranges
