## Project engine reference contract

When engine facts or APIs matter, explicitly run the native engine-reference command
and read .game-studio/resources/docs/engine-reference-resolution.md. <project-engine-reference> means its resolved
project.root and project.documents. Use actual project version/verification records;
missing records remain unknown. Packaged engine versions are historical background,
never project authority. Confirm current official APIs and actual toolchain before claims.

# AI Code Rules

- AI update budget: 2ms per frame maximum — profile to verify
- All AI parameters must be tunable from data files (behavior tree weights, perception ranges, timers)
- AI must be debuggable: implement visualization hooks for all AI state (paths, perception cones, decision trees)
- AI should telegraph intentions — players need time to read and react
- Prefer utility-based or behavior tree approaches over hard-coded if/else chains
- Group AI must support formation, flanking, and role assignment from data
- All AI state machines must log transitions for debugging
- Never trust AI input from the network without validation
