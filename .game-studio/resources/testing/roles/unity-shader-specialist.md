# Evaluation scenarios: gs-unity-shader-specialist

Professional scenarios adapted from Donchitos' upstream testing guidance; see
[source attribution](../../../../NOTICE.md). These are evaluation inputs and domain
checks, not executed results. Read `.codex/agents/gs-unity-shader-specialist.toml` and its current procedure first.
Use [evaluation policy](../README.md) and [category rubric](../quality-rubric.md).

Resolve current config and project engine records. Apply review-mode discipline
coverage without claiming automatic delegation: use the parent when needed, label it,
and record actual participants only. Existing human authorization governs writes;
case approvals represent unresolved decisions and never revoke prior authorization.
Historical fixture versions are scenario inputs, not current API verification.
The linked native procedure governs command arguments, output schemas, receipts,
context and mode applicability. Missing inputs remain NOT ASSESSED.

### Case 1: In-domain request — appropriate output
**Input:** "Create an outline effect for characters using Shader Graph in URP."
**Domain checks:**
- Produces a Shader Graph node setup description (inverted hull via vertex offset, or a screen-space depth/normal edge detection), named to its convention (e.g., `SG_Char_Outline`) with reusable logic in a Sub Graph
- Stays in Shader Graph and drops to custom HLSL only if Shader Graph cannot achieve the effect; any HLSL keeps SRP Batcher compatibility (`UnityPerMaterial` CBUFFER)
- For a screen-space variant, uses a URP `ScriptableRendererFeature` / `ScriptableRenderPass` recorded through the RenderGraph API (`RecordRenderGraph`), not the deprecated `Execute` / CommandBuffer path — per `<project-engine-reference>/unity/modules/rendering.md`
- Does NOT produce HDRP-specific nodes without confirming the render pipeline

---

### Case 2: Out-of-domain redirect
**Input:** "Implement the character health bar UI in code."
**Domain checks:**
- Does NOT produce UI implementation code
- Explicitly states that UI implementation belongs to `ui-programmer` (or `unity-ui-specialist`)
- Redirects the request appropriately
- Any part it keeps is the shader-driven effect only (e.g., a dissolve or fill gradient on the bar) — it writes no health-bar UI code

---

### Case 3: HDRP custom pass for outline
**Input:** "We're on HDRP and want the outline as a post-process effect."
**Domain checks:**
- Produces the HDRP custom pass pattern its own standards name: a C# class inheriting `CustomPass`, run from a Custom Pass Volume, drawing a full-screen edge-detection shader that samples the depth/normal buffers
- Uses the HDRP overrides `<project-engine-reference>/unity/current-best-practices.md` documents — `Setup(ScriptableRenderContext, CommandBuffer)`, `Execute(CustomPassContext ctx)`, `Cleanup()` — never URP's `RecordRenderGraph`, and marks any other HDRP member it uses (render-target helpers, `CustomPassContext` fields) unverified — nothing beyond those three is asserted from memory
- Notes that CustomPass requires HDRP package and does not work in URP
- Confirms the project is on HDRP before providing HDRP-specific code

---

### Case 4: VFX Graph performance — particle budget
**Input:** "The explosion VFX Graph has 10,000 particles per event and spawning 20 simultaneous explosions is causing GPU frame spikes."
**Domain checks:**
- Identifies GPU particle spawn as the cost driver (200,000 simultaneous particles)
- Sets a particle capacity limit per effect and sizes it against the < 2ms total VFX GPU budget
- Pools explosion VFX instances and triggers them through events, rather than creating a graph per explosion
- Reduces cost for distant or off-screen explosions (particle LOD, bounds-based culling) and scales counts by quality tier
- Avoids any fix that reads GPU particle data back to the CPU
- Does NOT change the gameplay event system — proposes a VFX-side budgeting solution

---

### Case 5: Context pass — render pipeline (URP or HDRP)
**Input:** Project context: URP render pipeline, targets PC and Nintendo Switch. Request: "Add depth of field post-processing."
**Domain checks:**
- Uses URP Volume framework: a `DepthOfField` override in a Volume Profile, with script access through `profile.TryGet<>()` as `<project-engine-reference>/unity/modules/rendering.md` shows
- Does NOT use HDRP Volume components (e.g., HDRP's `DepthOfField` with different parameter names)
- Places it on the Global Volume for the baseline look or a local Volume for an area, with priority and blend distance set
- Gates the effect per platform and quality tier — reduced or disabled on Switch — and keeps post-processing inside its 1-2ms frame budget
